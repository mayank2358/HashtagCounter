The project implements a HashTagCounter using Max Fibonacci Heap and Hash Table

There are two files: makefile and HashTagCounter.java

Step 1: Write make in cmd
(This will compile the java file)

Step 2: There are three scenarios for running the program

1) java HashTagCounter [input_file_name]

This will write the output in the console

2) java HashTagCounter [input_file_name] [output_file_name]

This will create a new file with name a [output_file_name] and write the output in that file

3) if the command will contain more than two arguments it will give a message of "Invalid input".
